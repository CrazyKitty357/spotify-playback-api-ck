# Spotify Playback Api 📻

### ⚠️ under development

The Spotify api is currently paywalled hence I decided to create an alternative one with the help of [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/),  
by injecting Javascript we are able to expose the api with a websocket,  
which can be accessed by starting a server on `localhost:443`  
Visit [Terminal Spotify](https://) for a simple demo.
